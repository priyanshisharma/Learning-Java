# Learning-Java

Hello Reader! This is my repository, documenting how I learnt Java. It was in the Girlscript Ireland Coding Bootcamp that I did it primarily. I also solved Hackerrank alongside to gain depth in concepts as well as practice. I also used Leetcode towards the end.

It was divided in four sessions.
The repository has 3 folders, each represents a Week, the folders contain another folder for my practice on leetcode Hackerrank et cetera.
I also got the Gold badge on Hackerrank ;) Check out my Hackerrank profile at https://www.hackerrank.com/priyanshi417 .

The questions we did during our meetings as well as practice work given during them are saved in the folder directly.
I also chose to get cerified by Hackerrank during Week 3 which is verifiable at https://www.hackerrank.com/certificates/9be22c1767be .

In the final meeting we completed the Tic-Tac-Toe game, I have also added a modified code which works more as per my intuition as TicTacToeTwo.java in the root folder, and so Week 4 doesn't have a dedicated folder.

And that was my **Journey to Java**
I would like to end this post with, by no means I'm a Java expert and C++ remains to be the language I feel most comfortable with when it comes to Problem Solving, but what I can tell you for sure is being exposed to new languages only improves your concepts and enhances your perspective, and ofcourse makes you more comfortable with new language as well as languages themselves!

All the best with your respective journeys!
